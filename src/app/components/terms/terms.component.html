                    <b>(a)	DEFINITIONS. </b>The following definitions govern the terms of this Paragraph 3 and as used elsewhere in these Terms:
                    <br/>•	<b>Bill Payment Cutoff Time</b> means 11:59 p.m. Central Time on any Business Day and is the time by which you must transmit Payment Instructions for such Payment Instructions to be considered effective for that particular Business Day.

                    <br/>•	<b>Payment Account</b> means your personal or business checking, savings, or money market account from which FLEX bill payments for your Account(s) may be made by you. FLEX recommends that you confirm with your banking institution any fees that you may be changed for bill payments from your Payment Account before designating a banking account as a Payment Account (e.g., your money market account may permit a limited number of transfers before fees are imposed).
                    <br/>•	<b>Payee</b> means FLEX or its subsidiary to which you direct a payment.
                    <br/>•	<b>Payment Instructions</b> means the information provided by you for a bill payment to be made to Payee (i.e., banking account number, ABA number, payment date, payment amount, and any additional information).
                    <br/>•	<b>Due Date</b> means the Business Day of your choice and as designated by you upon which your payment will be received by Payee and your Payment Account will be debited. Note: Your Payment Due Date may be no later than the “Due Date” set by FLEX for your most current bill.
                    <br/>•	<b>Pending Bill Payment</b> means a pending bill payment authorized by you through the Online Service that has not been debited to your Payment Account.
                </h5>
                <h5 class="description" >
                    <b>(b)	ONLINE ACCOUNT ACCESS.</b> For certain types of features available through the Web Site, including the Online Account Access features (the “Online Service”), we require the use of encryption technologies provided for your protection and/or your use of a user identification name (“UserID”) and password after setting up a user account (“User Account”). The Online Service is available by clicking on the Online Account Access login at www.flexinc.us. For self-enrollment, you must provide Account-specific information to authenticate yourself (e.g., Account owner name and address, Account number and meter number). You will be asked Account-specific information to authenticate yourself. In these Terms, “you” and “your” refer to each person, or, if applicable, the entity who is an owner, signer, or has unrestricted access to a User Account and each person that uses the Online Service with your permission (“Authorized User”). You may never use another person’s User Account and/or UserID without permission. When your Online Service is linked to one or more Accounts, FLEX may act on the oral, written, or electronic instructions of any authorized signer regarding your service for those Accounts. It is your responsibility to notify FLEX if an Authorized User should no longer be given access to an Account through the Online Service.
                </h5>
                <h5 class="description" >
                    <b>(c)	USER ACCOUNT AND PASSWORD.</b> We use reasonable precautions to protect the privacy of your UserID, password and User Account information by utilizing a Secure Socket Layer (“SSL”) connection. Accordingly, your UserID, password and User Account information are encrypted using an SSL connection and are not expected to be read in an intelligible form as they travel to the Web Site. You, however, are ultimately responsible for protecting your UserID, password and User Account information from disclosure to third parties, and you are not permitted to circumvent the use of required encryption technologies. You are required to take reasonable precautions to safeguard your UserID and password. You agree to never leave your computer unattended while using the Online Service and to always exit the Online Service by clicking on “Log Out.” You also agree to immediately notify FLEX of any unauthorized use of your UserID, password and/or User Account, or any other breach of security by email at info.flexinc@gmail.com, or through the online message center (if applicable). You are solely responsible for any activity that occurs with respect to your User Account and UserID. While we provide certain encryption technologies and use other reasonable precautions to protect your confidential information and provide suitable security, we do not and cannot guarantee or warrant that information transmitted through the Internet is secure, or that such transmissions are free from delay, error, interception or interruption.
                </h5>
                <h5 class="description" >
                    <b>(d)	RELIANCE BY FLEX.</b> You authorize FLEX to rely on your UserID and password to identify you when you use the Online Service, and as signature authorization for any payment made using the Online Service. You acknowledge and agree that you are responsible for all payments you make using the Online Service and for paying any and all late charges or penalties. You also acknowledge and agree that if you permit another person or persons to use the Online Service or give them your UserID and/or password, you are responsible for any payment that person makes to your Account, even if the person exceeds your authorization. You agree that FLEX may comply with the Payment Instructions entered by any person using your UserID and Password, subject to the terms set forth more fully below in the Unauthorized Payments section of these Terms.
                </h5>
                <h5 class="description" >
                    <b>(e)	SECURITY.</b> FLEX is committed to protecting the security and confidentiality of information about you and your Account and User Account. FLEX uses, and may in the future use, several different security methods to protect your Account and User Account information, including:
                    <br/>•	You can only access the Online Service with certain browsers that have high security standards.
                    <br/>•	If the Online Service does not recognize your computer, you will be prompted to answer one of your challenge questions to verify your identity.
                    <br/>•	The Online Service will automatically log off if prolonged periods of inactivity occur.
                    <br/>•	Your session will terminate if you navigate away from the Online Service to another website.

                    <b>(f)	ELECTRONIC COMMUNICATION.</b>
                    <b>(i)	Email and Online Message Center.</b> When you enroll in the Online Service, you must designate a primary email address that will be used for receiving electronic communication. To the extent that FLEX maintains an online message center now or in the future, such exchange of communications shall be considered an electronic communication and may be utilized by FLEX for providing you notices pursuant to these Terms, as required by Applicable Law (as permitted) or generally regarding your Account(s) with FLEX. FLEX will NEVER send you email requesting confidential information such as Account numbers, usernames, or passwords and you should NEVER respond to any email requesting such information. If you receive such an email purportedly from FLEX, do not respond to the email and forwarding the email to info.flexinc@gmail.com.
                    <b>(ii) Usage of Electronic Communication.</b> By your enrollment in the Online Service, you agree to receive these Terms and any disclosures or notices required by Applicable Law and all other communications electronically to the email address you designate in your account profile. You also agree that FLEX may respond to any communication you send to FLEX with an electronic communication, regardless of whether your original communication with FLEX was an electronic communication. Any electronic communication FLEX sends to you will be considered received within three (3) calendar days of the date such communication is sent by computer servers utilized by FLEX to the email address you designate in your account profile or posted to FLEX’s online message center (if applicable). To the extent permissible under Applicable Law, any electronic communication you send to FLEX will not be effective until FLEX has had a reasonable opportunity to act on the electronic communication. You should not rely on electronic communication if you need to communicate with FLEX immediately and, in no event, should your sole method of communication with FLEX regarding any emergency be by electronic communication. FLEX strongly suggests that you report all matters requiring immediate attention to FLEX by calling [INSERT PHONE NUMBER]. FLEX may require you to provide written confirmation of any verbal or electronic notice of alleged error by FLEX.
                </h5>

                    <b>(h)	PAYMENTS.</b> You authorize FLEX to debit your Payment Account and remit funds on your behalf to the Payee. When FLEX receives a Payment Instruction, you have authorized FLEX to debit your Payment Account and remit funds on your behalf so that the funds arrive as close as reasonably possible to the Payment Due Date as designated by you. You also authorize FLEX to credit your Payment Account for payments returned to you FLEX.
                </h5>

                    <b>(k)	INSUFFICIENT FUNDS TO COMPLETE BILL PAYMENT.</b> You must have sufficient available funds in your Payment Account on the Payment Due Date.

                    <b>(l)	FLEX’S LIABILITY FOR FAILURE TO COMPLETE BILL PAYMENTS.</b> If FLEX debits your Payment Account incorrectly, FLEX will be responsible for returning the improperly debited funds to your Payment Account. If FLEX does not complete a Bill Payment from your Payment Account on time or in the correct amount in accordance with your Payment Instructions, FLEX will be liable for the actual charges incurred by you, to the extent required by Applicable Law and in any event subject to paragraph 5 herein. However, FLEX will not be liable in the following situations:
